# Erbium
## By Aanand K, Nirmit A, Raghav G., William H. 
How many times has it happened that you thought of a really
cool idea, but you weren't sure if it had been done before,
how well received it would be. Or maybe, you were sure you
wanted to work on it, but needed help or funding.

Erbium was built to solve this problem. You can search for
other projects on Erbium, and see screenshots, a description
of the project, and a bit more information about it.

### How did we build Erbium?
We built Erbium with the standard web stack - HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript. Because we needed persistent data storage
and a few other features, we chose to utilize Firebase.

Erbium also makes use of Materialize for a host of UI 
niceties.

### Who can use Erbium
Anyone who wants to embark on a project can utilize
Erbium for funding or assistance, and to find out how
interested people are in seeing the project happen.

### What's next?
We plan to add a variety of ways to sort the projects,
into categories like trending, popular, most popular, etc.
Erbium can also use a major code overhaul ;).
